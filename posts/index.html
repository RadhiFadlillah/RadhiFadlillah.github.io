<p class=post-metadata>21 Sep 2019 by Radhi Fadlillah</p>
<p class=post-excerpt>Today Shiori v1.5.0 is released after almost five months of development (with several long breaks between). This release is quite huge with many changes and improvement from older version. Granted there are still some rough edges, but I think it’s still usable enough to release.</p>

<p class=post-metadata>11 Aug 2019 by Radhi Fadlillah</p>
<p class=post-excerpt>Today I found a weird bug in my company’s dashboard app where it took a long time to load data from SQLite database. The number of data is not too many (only around 400k&gt; rows), yet it took several seconds to load. This is really weird, especially considering SQLite is famous for its reading speed. Turn out, this issue is happened because I was using localtime date modifier in my SELECT query.</p>

<p class=post-metadata>29 Jul 2019 by Radhi Fadlillah</p>
<p class=post-excerpt>While working on Qamel, I want it to support compiling static app for Linux and Windows. When targetting Windows, this is simple enough thanks to project like MXE and MSYS2 which already provided static Qt libraries. However, when targeting Linux platform, there are no choice except building static Qt libraries by ourself.</p>

<p class=post-excerpt>When setting up a printer for my office, I realize that system-config-printer in Manjaro requires user to input the root password to add or modify a printer. It won’t allow users to do anything, until the root user unlock it :</p>
